# Image-Search-Engine
In this project I have created webpage with help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to search images.
Images it finds are related to your word.
It uses a unsplash API to get images which are copyright free.
It shows 12 images per page and I have provided show more button to get 12 additional images and so on.
